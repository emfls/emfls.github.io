<h2>📅 Skarberger 2 nights 3 days travel course</h2>
<div class="day-schedule">
<h3>Day 1: Skarberger Performance and Coast Cliff Tour</h3>
<p><strong>Skarberry Castle → Cliff Bridge → Scarberer Harbor → Captain Cook Memorial Museum</strong></p>
<div class="highlight">
<strong>Recommended time:</strong>9 hours<br/>
<strong>Core points:</strong>In the fascinating coastal city of Skarberer in Yorkshire, the northeastern United Kingdom, you can experience the magnificent castle of the 3000 -year history and the beautiful cliffs of the North Sea. Cliff Bridge, located on the limestone cliff, enjoys the magnificent natural scenery from the North Sea, walks along the coastal promenade, and tastes fresh seafood and traditional fish and chips in Skarberler Harbor, where lively fishing activities are followed. Through the exhibition based on the building where I worked, I finished the day by exploring the adventure story of one of European explorers.</div>

<h3>Day 2: North Bay and South Bay Beach Tour</h3>
<p><strong>North Bay Beach → North Bay Railway → South Bay Beach → Palm Park</strong></p>
<div class="highlight">
<strong>Recommended time:</strong>10 hours<br/>
<strong>Core points:</strong>In the two beaches of Scarberer's, the British traditional beach culture and family -friendly activity are experienced, the North Bay Beach, a calm and natural atmosphere, faces the cool sea breeze of the North Sea, enjoys the beach walk, collects shellfish and observes sea creatures, and rises directly on the model train with children on North Bay Railway, which has been operated for almost a century. Learn to control how to control, walk on a hamster ball, walk on the water, and experience a variety of plays that pass through the beams, and enjoy the amplitude facility that seduces visitors during the summer at the lively South Beach with taverns, bars and boutiques. Quietly around the lake, watch the top tower of the hill on the island of the lake, and watch the concert or the mock battle of the navy.</div>
